10:18 PM: Friend realizes that I am running a Half marathon for the first time and calls me up to check on my preparation. As we conclude that I have not eaten enough and I will call her when I am done with the race, I go eat more before I go to bed. 11:00 pm watching Ultra Runners Tedx talks for motivation I doze off into the night, not before I set multiple alarms on my phone to be up and early and laying out all my gear for the next day.

October 15, 2017

4:30 AM. Alarms go off. I was going to be doing something for the first time, run my first half marathon(21.097 KM). Leading up to today was decent runs whenever I got time to practice. Today, I have this feeling of joy, excitement and thirst for success. So I get up, already had all my gear laid out from the previous night. Attend all nature’s calls. Gear up and leave to the venue. On the ride to the venue, I know clearly have not practiced enough to set a good time. After finding my parking spot with much difficulty with all the traffic diverted and roads being closed for the race, I move towards the start line. As I reach the start line I look for 2 hour pacer but due to the enormous number of participants I was unable to spot him or get to him rather.

6:45 PM. The race begins, Only thing pondering in my head that I would be elated if I finish my first half marathon in Under 2 hours. So the race begin as a slow jog. I was eerily looking for the 2 hour pacer. I decided to hunt him down but I was pretty far behind. So far behind that I would have to cross 2:30,2:10 pacers before I could catch up to 2 hour pacer. The hunt began, I kept zigzagging and overtaking so many runners, spending a lot of energy in the beginning of the race with no luck of finding the 2 hour pacer. What I did find are the two 2 hour 30 minute pacers.Looking at them I realized that I have to step it up if I wanted to finish under 2 hours. Pursuit continued to find the 2 hour pacer. After the 5KM mark, My head realizes the weight of the situation I am currently at. I am not running a 10KM which would mean I am at the Half way point, This was 21KM race, which meant 16 more kilometers. HELL

7:XX AM

Tell myself to have a sips of water to prevent myself from dehydration. I had around 14 KM more to go. Running for 6 KM still no sight of the 2 hour pacer. I was finally sighted with the 2 hour 10 minute pacer, which gave me this insane release of energy to carry on forward. Now I come to understand that I am in between the 2 hour and 2 hour 10 minute zone, told myself pacer is right around the corner and keep myself hydrated. I reach 10 KM and from here on I am running on uncharted waters. Doing an 11th KM for the first time and have to do 10 more. Running is not easy, not fun, it’s hard, torture at one point.

In and around 8:XX

I hit the wall. The sudden feeling to just stop, legs start to give,toes start to melt, feel like I will collapse any moment now. I told myself then, I would finish this race in under 2 hours or I would die trying. Still no sight of the 2 hour pacer but the pursuit was still on. I reached 14KM mark, 7KM to go I tried my best that no one would pace me. Ran with a girl, did not get a look at her face but she pushed me to run faster without her knowledge. Running is beautiful that way, sense of tribe and to keep running with one and another. Kept running to encounter two Air force runners, I knew they were Air force by the shirts they were wearing. I could not keep up with them for much longer so they went along. Then I met an Individual and I asked him what the time is said he was running at 1 hour and 35mins but he started off late.

5 Kms left in the race, Still going at it. At this point I am going through hell. Fighting against all my thoughts to give up and go easy. I reminded myself repeatedly that have I will under 2 hours or I would die trying. Still no sign of the 2 hour pacer but look back and no sight of the 2 hour 10 minute pacer. I am somewhere in between.

Trying to dig deep for last bit of strength in my legs to finish the race. I recite to myself repeatedly “You can rest all you want when it is done right now Under 2 hours or die trying” Last 2 kilometers I see the stadium. Almost there. Pushing my body to finish it. 1 Kilometer left, severe pain. I would have stopped but people just cheering you to go and finish it.At this point no hope for the pacer and hoping I just finish around 1 hour 59minute mark. I go around that last turn and into the stadium like I was shot out of a canon and I cross the finish line.

I look back to see the clock it says 2 hours and 3 mins. Heartbreak to see, I missed it by 3 minutes. Then it striker me, I started the race late. I started in and around the 5 minute mark. I was euphoric to know I might have just done it. Who did I call my friend to tell her, she asked “Did you finish already?” and me without care to the question replied “I think I did it” she responds “Why do you not sure if you finished” then I clarified “ I think I did it under 2 hours”. I was in so much pain, legs cramping up, not able to walk properly. It didn't matter, I went to hell and back.

I come back home with my wobbly legs drinking water and energy drinks. I received my time on text which said

Running is no fun, it is not a physical task but a coming together of mind and body. I gave everything I could to finish it under 2 hours and I finished my first ever half marathon with a time of 1 hour, 57 minutes and 8 seconds.
